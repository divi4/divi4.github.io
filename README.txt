The code for my portfolio site that showcases my projects.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS

Using the Stellar template from HTML5UP I wrote up the content and repurposed the features section to be used to showcase my other projects.
I also altered the Javascript code to allow for smooth scrolling for all buttons on the site that are linked to anchors.

## Plan to add

* Link inquiry buttons to form on the site using express.js routing
* Add more projects behind a 'show more' button
* Refactor the code and measure time saved on loading

## Lessons Learned:

I learnt how to make smooth scrolling work and learnt the basics of jquery syntax during it. I also learnt how to effectively reuse code to save time and reduce bugs.

## My other projects:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:

**Afterlife:** https://github.com/divi4/afterlife

**Restaurant Demo:** https://github.com/divi4/demo-restaurant
